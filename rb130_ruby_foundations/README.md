## General Thoughts
This was a pretty enjoyable introduction to testing - I feel like this is a pretty important part of production ready code. Deploying(?) applications as a gem was also another concept that seemed pretty useful, but not necessarily useful within a job context. Blocks feel like they were a bit of a disparate concept and felt out of place within the rest of the course. I took a bit of a detour on this course to complete some of the Ruby challenges, which weren't too bad (some of them had some pretty obscure domain knowledge that was a little annoying to parse).
