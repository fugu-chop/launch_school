# LS175 - Networked Applications
This is a repo to house my notes and exercises for the LS175 course on Launch School. 
- Start date: 10th May, 2021
- Completion date: 4th June, 2021

## General Notes
This was a pretty long course, but probably one of the most enjoyable thus far. Building an end-to-end project that is not purely run in the CLI is really rewarding, especially when considering all of the security implications, and handling all the routing was really cool. The CMS project was also really cool in that it was structured as a series of non-technical use cases that I had to interpret as part of application design. That was really fun. I'm going to move onto LS202 (HTML & CSS) before building out an optional project, so that it doesn't look completely terrible when deployed.
