## General Thoughts
Object Oriented Programming is a brand new form of programming compared to the functional programming I was used to. I really like the 'LEGO-like' quality of classes and having them, interact with each other. This lesson took a fair while, because there was a significant amount of time dedicated to writing some pretty complex (and unusually structured) applications. 

There are a lot of new concepts to cover off though, so the material will likely take a while for me to fully revise before I'm ready for the assessments. 

It feels good to learn these things though, since this content is closer to how programming works in the real world. I feel just that little bit more knowledgable and qualified.
