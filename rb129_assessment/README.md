## General Thoughts
The written assessment wasn't too bad, though I know that if it were slightly more difficult or heavy on implementation or design questions, I would have struggled. It felt significantly longer than the RB109 written test. 

The interview assessment was notably more difficult, and in retrospect the extra time I spent revising didn't really help (I could have done it much sooner). There were some very tricky bits in respect of using instance methods and `self` to 'fix' code that couldn't be altered. I could also have done with slowing down, since I failed to pick up a local variable/instance variable distinction because I was racing through too fast.

Since I was able to explain my thinking, I still managed to ace both tests.
