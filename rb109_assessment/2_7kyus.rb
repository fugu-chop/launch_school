# 4 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side. The last element 0 is equal to the sum of its right elements (abstract zero). 
arrayLeaders ([1, 2, 3, 4, 0]) ==> 4

arrayLeaders ([16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]) ==> [17, 5, 2]

# 3) Write a function doubles that will remove double string characters that are adjacent to each other. The strings will contain lowercase letters only.
=begin
doubles('abbcccdddda') == 'aca'
a) There is only one 'a' on the left hand side, so it stays.
b) The 2 b's disappear because we are removing double characters that are adjacent. 
c) Of the 3 c's, we remove two. We are only removing doubles. 
d) The 4 d's all disappear, because we first remove the first double, and again we remove the second double.
e) There is only one 'a' at the end, so it stays.

doubles('abbbzz') == 'ab'

doubles('abba') == ""
When we remove the b's in 'abba', the double a that results is then removed.
