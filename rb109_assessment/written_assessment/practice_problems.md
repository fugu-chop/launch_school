*What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?*
```
a = ​‘Hello’ 
b = a
a = '​Goodbye​'
```
On `line 1`, the local variable `a` is initialised and assigned to the string object `'Hello'`. On `line 2`, the `b` variable is initialised, and assigned to the same string object that the local variable `a` is pointing towards (`'Hello'`). On `line 3`, the local variable `a` is reassigned to the string object `'Goodbye'`. When executed, `a` will return the string object `'Goodbye'`, while `b` will return the string object `'Hello'`.  This is because variables are pointers to objects, and are not themselves, values. On `line 2`, the local variable `b` is referencing the string object `'Goodbye'`, not the local variable `a`.

```
a = ​4
loop ​do 
  a = ​5
  b = ​3
  break
end

puts a
puts b
```
`line 8` will output the integer `5` and return `nil`, while `line 9` will return a `NameError`. 

The local variable `a` is initialised on `line 1` and assigned to the integer object `4`. A `loop` method is invoked on `line 2` with a block (denoted by the `do..end` reserved words). Variables within a block scope are able to access local variables initialised outside of the block scope - this is why the local variable `a` is reassigned to the integer object `5` within the block. 

Variables initialised within a block scope cannot be accessed outside of the block scope. On `line 4`, the variable `b` is initialised in the block scope, but not accessible outside of the block. This is why `line 9` will return a `NameError`. 

After each of the `a` and `b` variables are assigned a reference to an integer object, the `break` keyword exits the loop.

On `line 1`, the local variable `a` is initialised and assigned to the integer object `4`. On `line 2`, the local variable `b` is initialised and assigned to the integer object `2`. On `line 4`, the `loop` method is invoked with a block (denoted by the `do..end` reserved words). 

Within the block scope, the local variable `c` is initialised and assigned to the integer object `3` on `line 5`. On `line 6`, the local variable `a`, which is initialised outside of the block, but accessible from within the block scope, is reassigned to the same integer object `3` that the block variable `c` points to, since variables are pointers to objects. On `line 7`, the `break` keyword exits the `loop` method. 

The local variable `a` (which is a reference to the integer object `3`) is passed as an argument to the `puts` method on `line 10`, which will output the integer object `3` and return `nil`, while `puts` method call on `line 11` will output the integer object `2` (as referenced by the local variable `b`) and return `nil`, since the local variable `b` was not reassigned to a different object within the loop.

```
def​ ​example​(str)
  i = ​3
  loop ​do
    puts str
    i -= ​1
    ​break​ ​if​ i == ​0
  ​end
end

example(​'hello'​)
```
On `line 1 - 8`, we define the `example` method, which takes a `str` parameter. On `line 10`, we invoke the `example` method, passing the string object `'hello'` as an argument.

On `line 2`, within the method definition, we initialise a local variable `i` and assign it to the integer object `3`. On `line 3`, a `loop` method is invoked with a block (denoted by the `do..end` reserved words). 

On `line 4`, we call the `puts` method, passing in the local variable `str` as an argument. This `puts` call outputs the argument passed to the `example` method (`'hello'`), and returns `nil`. On `line 5`, the variable `i` is reassigned to the integer object `2`. The `i -= 1` line makes use of syntactical sugar (equivalent to `i = i - 1`), while the `-` method is also syntactical sugar for `.-()`. `line 6` checks to see if the object referenced by the variable `i` is equal to `0`. If this conditional evaluates to `true`, the `break` keyword will exit the loop. 

Overall, the code on `line 10` will print `'Hello'` three times, and return `nil`. The reason `nil` is returned is that Ruby has an implicit return on the last line of code within a method. This is the `break if i == 0` expression, which returns `nil`.

```
def​ ​greetings​(str) 
  puts str
  puts ​"Goodbye"
end

word = ​"Hello" 
greetings(word)
```
On `lines 1-4`, we define the `greetings` method, which takes a `str` parameter. On `line 6`, we assign the string object with a value of `'Hello'` to the local variable `word`. On `line 7`, we call the `greetings` method, passing in the `word` local variable (which references the string object `'Hello'`) as an argument. 

On `line 2`, when the `greetings` method is invoked, the `str` local variable is initialised when an argument is passed to the `str` parameter. In our case, this is the string object `'Hello'`. We then call the `puts` method, passing in the `str` local variable as an argument. This outputs `'Hello'` and returns `nil`. On `line 3`, the string object `'Goodbye'` is passed as an argument to the `puts` method, which outputs `'Goodbye'` and returns `nil`. 

The end result of `line 7` is that both `'Hello'` and `'Goodbye'` are outputted, and `nil` is returned. `nil` is returned because without an explicit `return` reserved word, the last expression evaluated in a method will be returned. In this case, `puts` returns `nil`.
