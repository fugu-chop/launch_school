## General Thoughts
This was an enjoyable slog. That's probably the most apt description I can give. While I've done other online courses for software development, I never feel like I've understood basic concepts to this extent. It just took a very long time and significant amount of perseverance to get here. 

I feel pretty good about my current knowledge level, and can confidently say that even though I've covered less overall content than I would in other online courses, I know the content far better, and can do far more with that content. 

Practicing for the interview assessment was extremely daunting - there was always another problem that was too hard, too confusing or too mathematical for me to solve. It was tough to even know when I knew enough to pass, or had an adequate level of competency. I guess sometimes you just have to go. 

Declarative programming was fun. Now onto object oriented programming.
