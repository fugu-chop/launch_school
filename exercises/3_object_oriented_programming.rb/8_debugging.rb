puts "In the display_high_priority_tasks method, Ruby first has to disambiguate the tasks name on the left-hand side of the assignment operator. It could in principle be either local variable assignment, or an invocation of the setter method. In this case, Ruby interprets it as local variable assignment. 

Recall that if we intended to invoke the tasks= setter method, we would need to use self to disambiguate from local variable assignment (self.tasks=). Next, Ruby must disambiguate the reference to tasks on the right-hand side of the assignment operator, seen in the code tasks.select. 

At this point, the getter method tasks is shadowed by the local variable that was just initialized on the left side of the assignment operator (this is initialized before the getter method is called). You can see this shadowing at work also in the private display method, where tasks in the method body refers to the method parameter, not the getter method - i.e. it will attempt to call .each on whatever object is referenced by the tasks method parameter and not the tasks instance variable returned by the tasks getter method.

As a result, both references to tasks in display_high_priority_tasks are interpreted as a local variable. This means that we initialize a local variable, and on the same line reference it via tasks.select, before it has been assigned a value. Invoking the select method on nil caused the error we see."
