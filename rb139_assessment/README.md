## General Thoughts
Another strong test performance. Overall, the coding challenge in this test wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it could have been, but I also think some of the questions weren't as difficult as they could be. I did finally drop a point in the test, where I didn't grasp that I could call a `Proc` object within a block - it was a weird implementation that I hadn't seen before. Preparation for this test was pretty smooth, but I think it was less comprehensive than I normally would have. I think that I can start going for assessments a little bit earlier than I normally would.
