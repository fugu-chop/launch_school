## General Course Notes
I like the use of Codecademy as a first step to learning Ruby generally, but I'm glad that these are only preparatory courses. 

My previous experience on Freecodecamp suggests that these REPL platforms are a good starting point, but don't really teach you the approach and mindset on how to code something more complex than a loop. They're almost too structured and focused on what they try to teach you.

__*Thoughts*__

Nothing too heavy so far. I've used the CLI pretty frequently through my 6 months or so of tutorials. I'm relatively familiar with navigation, so that didn't take too long. Practice was the most time consuming aspect of this. 

The environmental variable section was interesting - it's pretty similar to setting variables in other languages, and it gives me an idea of how to play around with my zsh settings. I'd previously just downloaded `.zshrc` files without really understanding what it was, or how it worked.

The idea of the `PATH` environmental variable is pretty cool. It's a shortcut for CLI to reference commands without the user having to specify the exact location where those commands are saved. 

Permissions is the newish content for me. Taking a little longer to wrap my head around it.

__*Thoughts*__

Finished off the book on the CLI. Permissions was a lot of stuff, but explained quite well and intuitively with examples in the book. Definitely helpful. 

I like how the Codecademy syntax seems to match the Rubocop style guidelines. Executing `.rb` files in the CLI is pretty slow.

Comparison operators are pretty similar to JS, which I am somewhat familiar with. String interpolation uses a different character to template strings in JS (`#` versus a `$`).
