__*Thoughts*__

Nothing too heavy so far. I've used the CLI pretty frequently through my 6 months or so of tutorials. I'm relatively familiar with navigation, so that didn't take too long. Practice was the most time consuming aspect of this. 

The environmental variable section was interesting - it's pretty similar to setting variables in other languages, and it gives me an idea of how to play around with my zsh settings. I'd previously just downloaded `.zshrc` files without really understanding what it was, or how it worked.

The idea of the `PATH` environmental variable is pretty cool. It's a shortcut for CLI to reference commands without the user having to specify the exact location where those commands are saved. 

Permissions is the newish content for me. Taking a little longer to wrap my head around it.
