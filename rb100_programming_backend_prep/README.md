# RB100 - Programming & Back-end Prep Notes and Log
This is a repo to house my notes and exercises for the RB100 course on Launch School.

## General Course Notes
I like the use of Codecademy as a first step to learning Ruby generally, but I'm glad that these are only preparatory courses. 

My previous experience on Freecodecamp suggests that these REPL platforms are a good starting point, but don't really teach you the approach and mindset on how to code something more complex than a loop. They're almost too structured and focused on what they try to teach you.
