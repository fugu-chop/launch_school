## General Course Notes
I like the use of Codecademy as a first step to learning Ruby generally, but I'm glad that these are only preparatory courses. 

My previous experience on Freecodecamp suggests that these REPL platforms are a good starting point, but don't really teach you the approach and mindset on how to code something more complex than a loop. They're almost too structured and focused on what they try to teach you. 

I think this was a really solid introduction to Ruby. There was a lot more focus on identifying subtle differences that don't normally get focused on, like differences in returned versus printed values, and how scope differs between method definitions and method invocations with a block. 

I also really enjoyed the focus on 'developer know how', like including sections on how to access and read documentation effectively, as well as interpret error messages and debug code. Content started simple, and built up with consecutively harder exercises, which I really enjoyed and thought was effective in building understanding.
