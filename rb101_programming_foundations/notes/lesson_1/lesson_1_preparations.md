# Lesson 1: Preparations

### PEDAC
PEDAC is a problem solving framework by which we can break down problems in order to solve them more quickly and efficiently. 

PEDAC stands for: 
- Understand the __P__roblem
  - Identify expected input and output
  - Make the requirements explicit
  - Identify rules
  - Mental model of the problem (optional)
- Write __E__xamples/Test Cases
  - Validate understanding of the problem
- __D__ata Structure
  - How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output.
- __A__lgorithm
  - Steps for converting input to output
- __C__ode 
  - Implementation of Algorithm

This framework helps avoid:
  - Missed requirements
  - Unforeseen Edge Cases
  - Hard to understand code
  - Code thatâ€™s difficult to maintain

Useful questions include:
1. Input formats? 
2. Empty inputs?
3. Output formats?
4. Do I return a new output, or a mutated output?
5. Verify your assumptions!
