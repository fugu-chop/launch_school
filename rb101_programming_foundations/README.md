## General Thoughts
I really enjoyed RB101. I think I really dove into some of the nitty-gritty details of Ruby that I ordinarily would just try to absorb through practice. I think I have improved my temperament for coding, like breaking down the problem, writing DRY code, abstracting longer code into more methods, and keeping the core logic short. I feel like I am in a good starting point for further practice, and preparing for the RB109 assessment.
