## General Thoughts
I quite liked this course from a conceptual level. I'm definitely not that familiar with how the internet works, and understanding some of the infrastructure and technologies that enables something so critical to my life is pretty interesting. It's not something I'd want to do as a job though. 

There is a __lot__ of content though - my challenge will be trying to build up a mental model that actually incorporates how all of the different layers fit together.
