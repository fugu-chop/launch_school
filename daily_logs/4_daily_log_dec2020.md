__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The debugging exercises were reasonably simple. This is encouraging as it makes me feel like I have a good intuition of where and what to look for when code throws errors. 

I need to get better with simultaneous loops. Intuitively, I can grasp the concept. I have real trouble writing code that expresses it, which is incredibly frustrating.
