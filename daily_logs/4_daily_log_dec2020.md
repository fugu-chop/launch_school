The debugging exercises were reasonably simple. This is encouraging as it makes me feel like I have a good intuition of where and what to look for when code throws errors. 

I need to get better with simultaneous loops. Intuitively, I can grasp the concept. I have real trouble writing code that expresses it, which is incredibly frustrating.

Polished off some more 6 kyu problems. Not too bad, though a lack of useful test cases does sometimes hurt and ruin the solution. I feel like I'm getting closer to 5th Kyu. I didn't end up recording myself just yet, since I'm taking the morning sessions to watch the live coding videos.

Interestingly, so far so good with 5 kyu. I haven't hit the hard wall with these problems just yet. I'm being much more deliberate in my application of PEDAC, writing significantly more detail to ensure that I have a good general grasp of what I need to write in order to solve the problem. 

There are still some times where I revert to testing out code willy-nilly, but I can improve this. I think part of my success is also due to making a conscious effort to read the problem properly and identify edge cases, rather than jumping straight in.

5 kyu problems have gone relatively smoothly so far. The more mathematical ones are probably still a little too tricky for me at the moment, or the ones that require optimisation (which probably aren't that appropriate in the first place). The grind continues.

Ran into a very hairy problem that required playing around with indexes and numbers. Those kinds of problems are always tricky where you have to simultaneously keep track of multiple variables. I managed to solve it, but it was too slow for Codewars. The solution was pretty novel, in that it used the order of iteration in it's favour to remove the need to track indices. Very clever.

Doing regex problems without regex is very annoying. It basically relies on really complex logic and conditional comparisons. I did manage to solve a reasonably complex regex problem, but it took me over an hour to get all the conditions working to handle all the weird edge cases (some of which were artificially contrived as part of the problem). Nonetheless, I am pretty happy that I was able to persist and get the solution out.

I've been grinding away super consistently for almost three full months now. Today is honestly the first day that I've just completely not felt like doing any coding. I'm just super tired all the time and find that I have no time for anything. It might be tricky to get all my coding done this weekend, given all the events on the social calendar. I might consider taking Sunday off. 

I'm starting to encounter more mathematical problems. They're basically impossible to solve unless you have a specific method or knowledge of the required algorithm. They're still useful in learning new methods, though.

I'm starting to encounter the badly worded 5 kyu problems, which makes them pretty hard to parse and write solutions for. I'm having to look in the discussions tab to find out what exactly the problem is asking for. 

It took me absolutely ages to figure out a relatively simple problem. I just couldn't muster the brain power to figure out the correct break condition, even though it was very simple in the end. That was incredibly frustrating.
