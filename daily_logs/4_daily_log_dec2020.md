__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The debugging exercises were reasonably simple. This is encouraging as it makes me feel like I have a good intuition of where and what to look for when code throws errors. 

I need to get better with simultaneous loops. Intuitively, I can grasp the concept. I have real trouble writing code that expresses it, which is incredibly frustrating.

Polished off some more 6 kyu problems. Not too bad, though a lack of useful test cases does sometimes hurt and ruin the solution. I feel like I'm getting closer to 5th Kyu. I didn't end up recording myself just yet, since I'm taking the morning sessions to watch the live coding videos.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Interestingly, so far so good with 5 kyu. I haven't hit the hard wall with these problems just yet. I'm being much more deliberate in my application of PEDAC, writing significantly more detail to ensure that I have a good general grasp of what I need to write in order to solve the problem. 

There are still some times where I revert to testing out code willy-nilly, but I can improve this. I think part of my success is also due to making a conscious effort to read the problem properly and identify edge cases, rather than jumping straight in.

5 kyu problems have gone relatively smoothly so far. The more mathematical ones are probably still a little too tricky for me at the moment, or the ones that require optimisation (which probably aren't that appropriate in the first place). The grind continues.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Ran into a very hairy problem that required playing around with indexes and numbers. Those kinds of problems are always tricky where you have to simultaneously keep track of multiple variables. I managed to solve it, but it was too slow for Codewars. The solution was pretty novel, in that it used the order of iteration in it's favour to remove the need to track indices. Very clever.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Doing regex problems without regex is very annoying. It basically relies on really complex logic and conditional comparisons. I did manage to solve a reasonably complex regex problem, but it took me over an hour to get all the conditions working to handle all the weird edge cases (some of which were artificially contrived as part of the problem). Nonetheless, I am pretty happy that I was able to persist and get the solution out.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I've been grinding away super consistently for almost three full months now. Today is honestly the first day that I've just completely not felt like doing any coding. I'm just super tired all the time and find that I have no time for anything. It might be tricky to get all my coding done this weekend, given all the events on the social calendar. I might consider taking Sunday off. 

I'm starting to encounter more mathematical problems. They're basically impossible to solve unless you have a specific method or knowledge of the required algorithm. They're still useful in learning new methods, though.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I'm starting to encounter the badly worded 5 kyu problems, which makes them pretty hard to parse and write solutions for. I'm having to look in the discussions tab to find out what exactly the problem is asking for. 

It took me absolutely ages to figure out a relatively simple problem. I just couldn't muster the brain power to figure out the correct break condition, even though it was very simple in the end. That was incredibly frustrating.

__*Time spent*__<br/>

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Going through some of the older problems and the more novel solutions for them was actually really valuable, as it reminded me of additional methods, things to watch out for, and tools which I can use to more easily solve problems. 

The 5 kyu problems continue to get more mathematical. It's a genuine struggle to find problems that aren't mathematical, optimisation or Regex based.

##### 10/12/20 (Thu)

  - Study Session

__*Time spent*__<br/>
121 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I did a live study session. It was a good benchmark of the level of detail I need to provide in my algorithm, as well as emphasising the need to include rules and test cases. I think I'll still a ways off in terms of identifying how to solve a given problem, so back to CodeWars I go. 

I definitely do need to spend more time in the algorithm naming variables and fully fleshing out the solution before I start coding. I still have a bad habit of hacking and slashing when I am unsure about the algorithm. It's also ok to not be too clever about the solution - I feel like I've spent a lot of time trying to think about the most optimal solution, but sometimes this doesn't cover all edge cases. 

Today was just super disheartening. I feel like I am nowhere near the level of skill required to actually solve any of these problems. I think I am just wasting my time on the 5 kyu Codewars problems now, since all the relevant problems seem to require Regex, mathematics, or algorithmic knowledge. I don't feel like I'm getting any better, either. 

I'm going to start recording myself doing problems from the compiled Launch School Codewars problems.

I did more of the compiled Codewars problems. It's a bit hit and miss. Sometimes I can easily solve them, sometimes I can't. I hope that just by doing more, I will get faster at it. The explanation part isn't too bad, but I do forget to step back and update the algorithm if my code doesn't work - I do explain my thought process, but a lot of it is probably hack and slash.

The PEDAC method is helping, but I'm still finding I jump through the diagnosis process too fast, missing test cases. I need to slow down.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I am making progress on reading the test cases more closely, but sometimes the katas don't reveal the true problem (useful test cases) until you actually attempt the problem, which feels a bit wasteful. I am also reducing my hack and slash tendencies, but I need to also verbalise my thought process as I think about updating algorithms.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I'm starting to feel burned out. My life has just been an endless series of Codewars problems. I'm finding it hard to manage all the things I have to do in life while still maintaining practice. The next few days are going to be rough, with a large amount of life stuff interfering with study. 

I'm glad I booked the assessment. I'm not sure if I'm ready honestly, but I just want some goal to aim for. I don't think I can do this Codewars grind for much longer. 

Frustratingly, I don't feel as though I am improving a lot. Progress is grinding and I find that I'm still not able to consistently identify good solutions to problems that are very easy compared to the assessment questions. My confidence in passing is currently very low.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The problems for today weren't too bad. I didn't really struggle with any of them - the ones that took a while were because I didn't get a full grasp of the problem based on the test cases, and thus attempted to implement a 'lazy' solution. It's another reminder to read the test cases and the problem, at least 5 times.

The joys of debugging. I still have some practice to do to make sure I keep talking through my debugging steps. I made an effort to read through a lot of the test cases, but it's sometimes hard to pick up all the necessary nuances. I'm worried that if I don't solve the problem on the first go, I will run out of time for the assessment.

Some more 5 kyu problems. After all the PEDAC practice I've had, I can now solve them, albeit slowly (some are still very mathematical). It's been a distracting day, but I managed to get the practice in. I will say, the quality of the practice was not as high.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
So incredibly frustrating. I worked through some of the previous problems that I had trouble with before. I haven't improved at all. I still can't completely solve them. The conditions I'm working in are incredibly distracting and annoying, but I don't think that would have a strong bearing on my coding ability. I think this is it. I won't pass the written assessment based off this.

I tried doing the difficult compiled CodeWars problems again. Thankfully, I was able to solve all of them, only some were a bit hairy and required quite a length of time to solve. I am still unsure of how I will perform on the day, especially given the added pressure.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
4 kyus are pretty challenging. I solved 2 and got pretty close with 2 others. Feels like decent preparation for the interview. Tomorrow, I think I'll try polishing off the sample problems I got from study sessions and the Watch Others Code videos. Then doomsday. Post update: I ended up spending another hour churning through some 4 kyus with little success. Probably a little too hard for me right now (and not necessary to pass).

I'm practicing the PEDAC method more deliberately, and working through some problems. Some of them can be tricky, but I feel like because I am taking my time reading through the test cases and re-reading the problem, it actually saves time. So far, so good I guess.

I spent the morning polishing off some smaller problems, which I was able to solve fine. The actual interview went relatively smoothly (no overly obscure mathematical principles). It took about 25 minutes all up. Apparently I nailed the assessment, maxing out both the technical and non-technical grades. I guess I thought it would be more difficult than it was.

__*Time spent*__<br/>

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Object oriented programming is a completely different way of structuring code to what I was used to in RB101, where we would just define a whole bunch of methods to do different things. I suppose it's more intuitive to group functionality according to entities, and keep code nice and confined to reduce bugs and dependencies. It feels weird to be covering completely new content, and it's a lot to digest so far.

Merry Christmas. Spent some time revising what I'd learned yesterday. There was a lot of very new and unfamiliar stuff to cover. It was definitely helpful, and will prevent those instances where I move forward too quickly, only to discover too late that my foundational knowledge is incomplete, and I get super confused.

I find the `self` keyword(?) confusing, especially all the discussion around it's scope. I will re-read this tomorrow.

More tricky material. All the nuances of modules and inheritance are hard to keep track of, especially since you can group classes and methods into modules. The rules for Private and Protected are also a little fuzzy currently. This will probably only become more familiar through practice and revision.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I managed to clear up some confusion between `protected` and `private` methods - protected methods allows access by instances of the same class. Exercises so far haven't been too bad, but I continually get tripped up by using the `self` prefix when I haven't set up setter methods. In those cases, I'm better off using an instance variable.
