The debugging exercises were reasonably simple. This is encouraging as it makes me feel like I have a good intuition of where and what to look for when code throws errors. 

I need to get better with simultaneous loops. Intuitively, I can grasp the concept. I have real trouble writing code that expresses it, which is incredibly frustrating.

Polished off some more 6 kyu problems. Not too bad, though a lack of useful test cases does sometimes hurt and ruin the solution. I feel like I'm getting closer to 5th Kyu. I didn't end up recording myself just yet, since I'm taking the morning sessions to watch the live coding videos.

Interestingly, so far so good with 5 kyu. I haven't hit the hard wall with these problems just yet. I'm being much more deliberate in my application of PEDAC, writing significantly more detail to ensure that I have a good general grasp of what I need to write in order to solve the problem. 

There are still some times where I revert to testing out code willy-nilly, but I can improve this. I think part of my success is also due to making a conscious effort to read the problem properly and identify edge cases, rather than jumping straight in.

5 kyu problems have gone relatively smoothly so far. The more mathematical ones are probably still a little too tricky for me at the moment, or the ones that require optimisation (which probably aren't that appropriate in the first place). The grind continues.
