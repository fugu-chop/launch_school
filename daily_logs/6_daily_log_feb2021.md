Some good revision today. The rest of the problems in the written problem practice set are much smaller and faster to answer than the previous ones. They also generally retread on similar concepts, so I'm going through these much faster. I think once I finish all of the written problems, my next step is to reference these answers with the written materials, refine and then practice writing them out very quickly.

A lot of today's revision was focused on method overriding and operators, which I knew would be a relatively weak area for me. I'll need to make some time to review my answers for these questions, as they can get quite detailed.

I've finished the set of written sample problems. I'm now reviewing these answers, and when I'm happy with the level of detail, will start to practice covering off the relevant points (and typing these out quickly!).

I'm not sure if it was because I was half-asleep, but I really struggled to describe protected methods in the study session. All the other questions were ok, I think. Definitely need to revise protected methods, as well as the `super` keyword. The `private`, `protected` and `super` keywords are all methods.

The grind continues. I'm definitely burning out a little bit on Launch School. However, now I feel as though I am slightly improving on the quality of definitions, I just have to make sure I have a fully fleshed out definition - covering all the little points that I might miss. I'll need to continue to practice, and I feel like I'm getting ever so slightly faster.

More revision today. I didn't feel too bad about writing out my answers. They could be shorter, but I can type fairly quickly, and recall most of the important points to write down. I'm getting closer to the written assessment, I feel. I also made a breakthrough in understanding what it means for the state of objects to be unique - it's not necessarily the values assigned to instance variables that need to be unique; it's more that the objects **don't share state between other instances of the same class**.

Finished off the second round of written answers practice. I feel decent about them, although I still have a few edge case points of information that I need to include in my answers. I think I will definitely need the pre-written code snippets I have for the actual test though - I feel like it's too time consuming to write these alongside detailed explanations of principles.

Revising answers is pretty handy in picking up the specific points I missed around the first time. I want to take a break from writing these same answers out on a computer over and over again though. Tomorrow I will start on the quiz files, just for a change of pace. I'll then start revising the written 'concept' answers by writing them out physically. I find that I'm just not retaining all the different answers - it's almost like when I remember a new answer, an old answer leaves my memory. It's a little frustrating.

This was a nice change of pace. I honestly completely forgot to revise the RB120 quizzes, so it's nice to cover that off while also having a new set of questions that I could practice writing definitions for.

Again, I found some haziness with how `super` works when called with differing number of arguments between subclasses and superclass. More revision necessary, but I think I feel good about doing the written test this weekend.

That's a wrap for the written assessment preparation. I feel reasonably well prepared for the test. I hope I can manage my time effectively. That's my real concern here at the moment.

Finished off the written test today. There definitely were a few more open ended questions here, as well as some questions which I thought were a bit hard to score out of 5 (they would either be 0 or 1, in my view). Hopefully I do reasonably well.

So I got my written assessment back already. The 100% train continues. Now I'm focused on being able to talk through my written assessment explanations. It's a pretty different skillset and I can tell already I'll need at least a week to talk through this stuff confidently.

Talking is hard. I get thirsty. It's also very different from writing answers because you don't get to retract statements or rephrase them. I'll continue to talk through my example answers until I'm much more fluid with them.

More talking. I think by slowing down, I'm more able to articulate all the relevant points in an answer. A few more rounds of talking through the written answers and I'll be able to start incorporating code examples into my explanations.

I had another 3am study session, which went significantly better than last time - I was actually able to answer questions despite being half asleep. Not sure if I'm tired or something, but this afternoon I suddenly found it hard to recall answers to the written assessment practice questions. I've also booked in my interview assessment for RB129 in a week's time. That should be ample preparation.

Going through even very basic code examples (like the practice problems) is helpful - in preparing for the written assessment, I've been so railroaded into specific examples demonstrating principles that I've become overly reliant on them. The basic code examples are helpful for consolidating concepts that have become overly restricted through my preparations.

More explanations. I didn't seem to lose too much of my rehearsed answers, and I managed to enhance the answers using the revision materials. Pretty worthwhile exercises. That being said, I'll need to practice speaking through my rehearsed answers, as well as writing code examples while speaking.

After browsing the Launch School Slack, I've realised that my functional programming skills have atrophied considerably. I barely remember any of the methods that I used to solve for problems in RB109. I think once I finish RB129, I'll swing back to RB109 and revise all the concepts, and practice the problems again. I think migrating my notes to Notion will also help this.

Whoops, I had one full day of revision, not two (I got the days confused). I had a headache leading up to the assessment, which was bothersome. The actual test was quite challenging - the last question in particular required chaining methods together and replacing what Ruby was interpreting as an instance variable with a method call. I definitely didn't do as well this time, but I'm happy that I was actually able to solve all of the problems without prompting from the assessor.

I ended up acing the interview assessment, though it was certainly harder than the last time. Before proceeding to RB130, I think I'm going to sweep through and revise RB101, since I feel like I've forgotten a fair bit of useful knowledge. It's interesting re-reading my notes from RB101, since a lot of the definitions make a lot more sense/are more contextual after covering RB120.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Today was mostly brushing up on pass by reference (basically everything) and values (immutable objects & variable reassignment), as well as some of the more commonly used array and hash methods. Pretty good revision, especially since the OOP content I just covered gives more flavour to the definitions around mutable objects just being changes in state to an object (since the `object_id` does not change, even if we change the state of an object).

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
More revision is helpful - even though objects might duplicated and different from one another, if they are collections, the objects within the collections can be shared. We need to check if the operation we're performing is at an element, or object level - an element level change (e.g. element reassignment, or mutating method on each element) will alter the element across both collections, whereas altering something at the object level (e.g. `map` called on a collection), will __not__ alter both collections.

Assuming an object is frozen (i.e. has `.freeze` called on it):
- `dup` will __not__ preserve the frozen status (i.e. we can alter the object at an object level without issue)
- `clone` __will__ preserve the frozen status (we __cannot__ alter the object at an object level)

I'm also committing to doing a small amount of the collated Codewars problem from RB109, just so my skills don't totally atrophy again. Just 2 a day, to keep things fresh. I am very rusty - the first two problems took me 33 minutes together, which is pretty long. Hopefully as I keep doing these, I'll get back to my original level.
