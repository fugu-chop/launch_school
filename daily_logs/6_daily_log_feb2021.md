__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Some good revision today. The rest of the problems in the written problem practice set are much smaller and faster to answer than the previous ones. They also generally retread on similar concepts, so I'm going through these much faster. I think once I finish all of the written problems, my next step is to reference these answers with the written materials, refine and then practice writing them out very quickly.
