Some good revision today. The rest of the problems in the written problem practice set are much smaller and faster to answer than the previous ones. They also generally retread on similar concepts, so I'm going through these much faster. I think once I finish all of the written problems, my next step is to reference these answers with the written materials, refine and then practice writing them out very quickly.

A lot of today's revision was focused on method overriding and operators, which I knew would be a relatively weak area for me. I'll need to make some time to review my answers for these questions, as they can get quite detailed.
