I really enjoy writing logic. Abstracting out bits of logic into methods isn't something I've done a lot of in the past, but I'm really enjoying it for it's troubleshooting benefits, even if it does introduce a bit of complexity around variables' local scope. 

Other little pointers and things to remember from my revision:
- Methods with a `?` in the name should return a boolean as good practice.
- Mutating methods can be expressed as "changing the address space in memory", while non-mutating methods as "changing the variable to point to a different address space".

I encountered some trickiness around methods when building the additional features for Rock Paper Scissors, again determining what a method should return. It's cool being able to use truthiness as a way to shortcut a lot of code and conditional testing.

I'm getting a better grasp of breaking apart logic into methods, and after having to debug some strangeness, am confident it's definitely the right way to go about programming. 

The only thing I'm concerned about is speed. I heard that the RB109 assignment is only three hours with multiple questions - it took me about 45 minutes to build and troubleshoot one additional feature. I'm hoping with significant practice, I can speed this up. 

The quiz was hard. I have a reasonable intuitive understanding of concepts, but have a hard time verbalising those concepts into writing. This is one criticism I have about the content so far - sometimes the quiz questions are a little vague, while the answers are incredibly pedantic in their semantics. 

I am finding the medium problems quite difficult. It's being able to logically unpack what is required in the question, finding an appropriate method where possible and if not, writing something custom. Where I'm struggling is writing correct syntax to apply logic, as well as applying all of the rules in a sequential manner to figure out what the correct output should be.

A lot of these exercises about object_ids changing are honestly really annoying (they're not proactive exercises, just time-consuming reading very verbose and poorly written methods), and I really question the necessity of learning such specific terminology, so long as we are able to implement them in our code. I will spend tomorrow revising the three blog posts regarding object_ids and how/what things get reassigned when variables are reassigned.
