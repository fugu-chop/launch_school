__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I really enjoy writing logic. Abstracting out bits of logic into methods isn't something I've done a lot of in the past, but I'm really enjoying it for it's troubleshooting benefits, even if it does introduce a bit of complexity around variables' local scope. 

Other little pointers and things to remember from my revision:
- Methods with a `?` in the name should return a boolean as good practice.
- Mutating methods can be expressed as "changing the address space in memory", while non-mutating methods as "changing the variable to point to a different address space".
