Working with blocks and implementing our own custom implementations of existing Enumerable methods is fun. Actually coding and solving problems is significantly more fun than revising for tests, and has re-energised me for Launch School.

I finished Lesson 1 of what looks to be a pretty short module. I did some revision as a lot of the concepts are cumulative and currently hard to recall in my mind. I'll do the quiz tomorrow morning.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
After some revision, I realised that the implementation for one of my code examples was wrong since it was an edge case I didn't think of. This is probably a habit I need to get used to - I can practice this through my Codewars revision. Positively, I am also getting better at Codewars problems. Today was pretty fast and got through the solution relatively easily.

Blocks and Procs are pretty tricky. I was having a hard time distinguishing between use of the unary `&` operator in the context of method invocation versus method definition. The next point of confusion for tomorrow is binding and what's in scope when a Proc object is created.
