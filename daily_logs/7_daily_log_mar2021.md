__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- RB130 - Ruby Foundations
  - Closures & Blocks revision
  - Custom method implementations
  - Todo List Problem
- Revision
  - Codewar Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Working with blocks and implementing our own custom implementations of existing Enumerable methods is fun. Actually coding and solving problems is significantly more fun than revising for tests, and has re-energised me for Launch School.

__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- RB130 - Ruby Foundations
  - Todo List Problem
  - Blocks and Variable Scope
  - `Symbol#to_proc`
- Revision
  - Codewar Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I finished Lesson 1 of what looks to be a pretty short module. I did some revision as a lot of the concepts are cumulative and currently hard to recall in my mind. I'll do the quiz tomorrow morning.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
After some revision, I realised that the implementation for one of my code examples was wrong since it was an edge case I didn't think of. This is probably a habit I need to get used to - I can practice this through my Codewars revision. Positively, I am also getting better at Codewars problems. Today was pretty fast and got through the solution relatively easily.

Blocks and Procs are pretty tricky. I was having a hard time distinguishing between use of the unary `&` operator in the context of method invocation versus method definition. The next point of confusion for tomorrow is binding and what's in scope when a Proc object is created.

  - Lesson 2: Minitest

  - Codewar Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The Codewars problems were particularly tricky today. That's ok, they were rated as pretty hard. Testing is pretty weird. The syntax and language are completely different to what I'm used to, and the testing suite output is pretty unfamiliar. All very exciting!

  - Codewar Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Writing tests is kinda fun. You have to create some scenarios in your head, attempting to find edge cases that could break your code. It's another way to make your code more resilient to errors when writing it in the first place - thinking about the tests you would write.

  - Lesson 2: Minitest
- Exercises
  - RB130 - Easy 1
- Revision
  - Codewar Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>
155 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
It's good to go back to coding the exercises. Unlike previous sets of exercises, the Easy 1 problems are actually interesting and I get a lot of value by reading other students' solutions. It's quite good.

##### 07/03/21 (Sun)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- Exercises
  - RB130 - Easy 1, 2, Easy Testing
- Revision
  - Codewar Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>
209 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The testing exercises were pretty cool, and the exercises more generally are quite good at assessing my comprehension of concepts. It didn't seem to click to me that `yield` actually returns something, which was a blocker for one of my solutions.

##### 08/03/21 (Mon)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- Exercises
  - RB130 - Medium 1, Medium Testing
- Revision
  - Codewar Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>
123 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I still find `Proc` objects slightly confusing conceptually. I need to revise the concepts and apply them more. Working across different classes in collaboration for testing is quite challenging - I need to get used to this again.

##### 09/03/21 (Tue)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- Exercises
  - RB130 - Medium Testing

  - RB130 Concepts
  - Codewar Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>
122 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Woke up feeling not particularly refreshed. I spent some time in the morning doing revision instead - I feel like I'm moving a little too quickly through the content. The Medium testing stuff is getting weird. There's a lot of working with concepts that haven't been introduced thus far, like working with `StringIO` objects.

##### 10/03/21 (Wed)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- Exercises
  - RB130 - Medium Testing, Advanced 1
- RB130 Study Session
- RB130 Quiz

__*Time spent*__<br/>
123 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The study session was a bit of a wash. We really didn't cover off anything useful to RB130, and went off on various tangents beyond the curriculum. I'm not going to log the hours as part of study. 

The quiz wasn't too bad. I found I retained a fair bit of information, but need to brush up on the specifics of the test outputs when they fail.

##### 11/03/21 (Thu)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- Exercises
  - RB109 - Advanced 1

__*Time spent*__<br/>
131 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
A bit hit and miss with the advanced exercises. I sometimes hit a mental block, and then I get PTSD flashbacks of my time in RB109, hitting my head against a wall. However, once I calm down, I realise that the problems aren't actually that hard to solve - it's just hard to figure out what exactly I am supposed to do. I just need to calm down, break down the problem.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Recursion is pretty tricky for me to wrap my head around. The order of method execution and what actually gets executed before the loop begins is hard for me to tackle. These problems are also getting a lot harder - I can't reliably solve them now. I still need to take a deep breath and resolve the panic mode that I can get into if I can't unpack the problem quickly.

##### 13/03/21 (Sat)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- Exercises
  - Ruby Challenges

__*Time spent*__<br/>
188 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The challenges are pretty fun, and the test suite makes identifying edge cases a lot easier. I am going through them pretty easily, though I did have an issue with the Roman numeral conversion. I had to make use of the `divmod` method, which I didn't think of, and tried to use some hacky mathematics which didn't allow for correct calculation of remainders.
