__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Working with blocks and implementing our own custom implementations of existing Enumerable methods is fun. Actually coding and solving problems is significantly more fun than revising for tests, and has re-energised me for Launch School.

I finished Lesson 1 of what looks to be a pretty short module. I did some revision as a lot of the concepts are cumulative and currently hard to recall in my mind. I'll do the quiz tomorrow morning.

After some revision, I realised that the implementation for one of my code examples was wrong since it was an edge case I didn't think of. This is probably a habit I need to get used to - I can practice this through my Codewars revision. Positively, I am also getting better at Codewars problems. Today was pretty fast and got through the solution relatively easily.

Blocks and Procs are pretty tricky. I was having a hard time distinguishing between use of the unary `&` operator in the context of method invocation versus method definition. The next point of confusion for tomorrow is binding and what's in scope when a Proc object is created.

The Codewars problems were particularly tricky today. That's ok, they were rated as pretty hard. Testing is pretty weird. The syntax and language are completely different to what I'm used to, and the testing suite output is pretty unfamiliar. All very exciting!

Writing tests is kinda fun. You have to create some scenarios in your head, attempting to find edge cases that could break your code. It's another way to make your code more resilient to errors when writing it in the first place - thinking about the tests you would write.

It's good to go back to coding the exercises. Unlike previous sets of exercises, the Easy 1 problems are actually interesting and I get a lot of value by reading other students' solutions. It's quite good.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The testing exercises were pretty cool, and the exercises more generally are quite good at assessing my comprehension of concepts. It didn't seem to click to me that `yield` actually returns something, which was a blocker for one of my solutions.
