I'm starting to write out my answers for potential questions to the written assessment. This is going to be time consuming, but is valuable in forcing me to revise the concepts and distil them down. Writing questions and answers for the Transport layer was pretty hard - I had to parse all my notes, which are pretty scattered and hard to piece together.

Revision continues. It's slow going, and I'm not entirely sure if I'm retaining all the knowledge in this first pass. Positively, I'm almost done with the topics on the study guide - the breadth of the actual assessment isn't nearly as intimidating as the coursework itself.

I accidentally slept in today and ended up having to do the two hours of study during the evening. As per my previous experience, this doesn't work particularly well after a long day at work. The second hour of study isn't nearly as productive as the first, as fatigue starts to creep in. I finished off my templated answers and tidied them up.
