__*Time spent*__<br/>
185 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I'm starting to write out my answers for potential questions to the written assessment. This is going to be time consuming, but is valuable in forcing me to revise the concepts and distil them down. Writing questions and answers for the Transport layer was pretty hard - I had to parse all my notes, which are pretty scattered and hard to piece together.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Revision continues. It's slow going, and I'm not entirely sure if I'm retaining all the knowledge in this first pass. Positively, I'm almost done with the topics on the study guide - the breadth of the actual assessment isn't nearly as intimidating as the coursework itself.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I accidentally slept in today and ended up having to do the two hours of study during the evening. As per my previous experience, this doesn't work particularly well after a long day at work. The second hour of study isn't nearly as productive as the first, as fatigue starts to creep in. I finished off my templated answers and tidied them up.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I'm retaining the earlier concepts reasonably well, and able to communicate them more succinctly. It's good progress, which is helpful because generally, I'm starting to feel a little burned out.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
More revision. The earlier topics I'm able to recall somewhat clearly, though basically anything from URLs onwards I'm struggling to recall the details of. More practice needed, but I should be ready to take the test reasonably soon.

I went through the quizzes today, and was able to get all of the answers right. I think I'm basically at the point where I can feel confident to take the test. 

##### 09/05/21 (Sun)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS171 Assessment

__*Time spent*__<br/>
138 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The test went by relatively quickly. The use of templated answers was very handy, as I don't think I could have written out answers and still finished in time. This is honestly the test I'm least confident about, since so much of it is theory and dependent on interpretation of the question. Let's see how I do.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Revision this morning was a bit distracted - I couldn't get into the zone for studying. I aced the LS175 assessment, which was nice. I started up on LS175 - it's fun to get back to the implementation side, rather than pure theory.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I spent the morning doing further optimisations to the simple echo server. I had some compatibility issues with Firefox in rendering the response - there were some additional `puts` statements and response headers I had to throw in before the response showed up correctly.

Tracking state in the URL query strings is something covered in LS170, though it's cool to see it in action.

__*Time spent*__<br/>
120 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Spent the morning doing some reading of the Ruby application server architecture. I found it pretty hard to digest, but once I got to the architectural diagram, everything made sense. The afternoon session was looking at Rack, and deploying a simply Rack application using templates (ERB).

##### 13/05/21 (Thu)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>

  - Working with Sinatra
    - Building a simple Rack app
    - Sinatra

__*Time spent*__<br/>
120 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I finished up the very basic Rack app. It wasn't too hard to follow, and tied in some useful concepts previously learned, like bindings of closures, mixin modules versus class inheritance, and some refactoring of code. I also learned that if a method is expecting a positional argument at the end, any name: value pairs that aren't treated as keyword arguments get gathered up into a single hash.

I moved onto the next part of the coursework, which looking at Sinatra. Using Ruby 3.0.0 keeps tripping me up, as I need to remember that the `webrick` gem is not installed by default.

__*Time spent*__<br/>
127 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Had a mini-heart attack when I thought my bundler wasn't working correctly. After wasting significant amounts of time trying to troubleshoot, I found out I was using the wrong command to execute my Ruby files. How embarrassing. In the afternoon, I tried the Dynamic Directory Index challenge. The solution relied on a `params` variable that Sinatra automatically provides as part of each request. I'm still wrapping my head around variables being passed between different files - I need to remember that a page refresh (e.g. triggered by clicking on a link that adds a query string) triggers another HTTP request, which executes the block in the `get` method in the Ruby file.

__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS175 Networked Applications
  - Working with Sinatra
    - Book Reader App

__*Time spent*__<br/>
185 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Today's session was really difficult. Working through the Sinatra search enhancements in particular was difficult - I built a solution that met the needs of the assignment, but didn't leave much room for enhancements on top for the next assignment, as I basically railroaded myself into an approach that didn't allow for extraction of nested hash values in an intelligent way. The solution required use of blocks, which I understand, but still don't have a strong background with.

__*Time spent*__<br/>

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The morning session was pretty good. I managed to finish off the Book Reader app formatting exercises, without consulting the solutions. The Users and Interests assignment also wasn't too bad - I was able to use `layout.erb` (beyond the suggested solution), which was valuable practice.

The afternoon was spent on quizzes and deploying to Heroku. I felt like the course materials didn't give enough of a background to Heroku and just jumped straight into it. I had to do some additional reading and troubleshooting in order to get the application deployed, but it works, and life is good.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I spent the morning reading through some of the error posts in Launch School to help me understand the individual components of the book viewer app (e.g. `config.ru`, `Procfile`) and what they're used for.

The afternoon was spent revision the architectural model of the application; e.g. what is a web server versus application server, where does it fit, what libraries/frameworks are used.

##### 18/05/21 (Tue)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>

  - Todo List in Sinatra

__*Time spent*__<br/>
127 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I spent the morning revising some of the concepts around server architecture. I feel like I have a much stronger grasp of what the technologies are and where they fit in the architecture. I also got a bit more familiar with the different functionalities of Sinatra. 

In the afternoon, I moved onto the next project, a Todo List app built in Sinatra. Immediately after unzipping the template files I ran into compatibility issues. A simple deletion of the `Gemfile.lock` file and running `bundle install` with a newer version of Sinatra helped, but I feel like LS should be maintaining this sort of thing.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The morning was spent reading through documentation and getting a better understanding of the code so far in the Sinatra todo application. It's quite satisfying being able to read different sources of documentation for different languages and still being able to piece them together and understand what is happening. For my particular case, I was wondering how the `params[:attr_name]` was populated in a `POST` request. As I understand it, Sinatra looks at the `name` attribute of the input field, and captures the value submitted as a `name:value` pair _in the response body_.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Spent the day adding new functionality to the Todo list. I'm happy to say that I was able to handle an edge case the instructor thought was overly complex relative to the benefit (i.e. handling renaming a list when the user inputs the old name of the list). It required some tricky capturing of the state of a variable before it got changed due to a POST request.

193 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I took on Talbet's suggestion to write a more detailed `README` to explain what the app does, how to get it running and the design choices. This is actually a pretty enjoyable exercise for me - it lets me reflect on the project thus far and explain some of the design choices used.

I also like that I was able to code up most of the solutions before watching the video (in contrast to earlier study sessions), and anticipate the problems that would be encountered, and took the 'optimal path' to solving those issues.

  - Quiz

__*Time spent*__<br/>
182 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I'm definitely lacking a bit of practice when it comes to blocks and `Proc` objects. I can understand the code when I see it, but I don't have that muscle memory of creating code that takes advantage of it. I'm also finding it hard to keep track of the correct level of nesting/granularity on my code - I'm finding that all the different methods are operating at different level of the hash, making it incredibly annoying to go through the code and understand what level I should be accessing a hash at.

I managed to deploy the application to Heroku without any major issues. Today was just a bad day for studying - I just really couldn't be bothered. I completely screwed up the quiz - I just did not have the inclination to read deeply into the code to pick up small differences in where particular characters were placed, or second guess the wording of questions.

__*Time spent*__<br/>
120 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The morning session was to go through my terrible quiz performance and understand the answers. I don't think I would have done much better with more patience - there was a lot of weird wording and the questions were hard to understand.

The evening session was adding to the Sinatra to-do list app; sanitising HTML input and preventing bad inputs from occuring by using redirects.

- LS175 Networked Applications
  - Revision (Blocks, `self`)
  - HTTP Methods and Security
  - Quiz

__*Time spent*__<br/>
128 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I spent some more time this morning just revising blocks again, and the use of the `self` keyword, after not really understanding how the `Integer` class was able to implement an instance method like `times` - it's basically like any other method, just defined within the `Integer` class. Just as a mental note, I should add it to my problem solving mindset whether I can resolve a problem more easily using a method that yields to a block - this is especially helpful if I have to iterate through an `Enumerable` object, but the idiosyncracies of `each` or other similar methods cause issues (e.g. `each` returns the object on which it is called, which can be annoying). That will open up a whole bunch of flexibility to my problem solving techniques.

__*Time spent*__<br/>
119 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The morning session was trying to understand why the syntax for escaping HTML in my Todo app did not react to the `<%== %>` syntax. It's because the syntax is actually part of a method call, `escape_html`, and Ruby does not like conditionals as arguments in a method call. The other reading I did in the morning was to look at environmental variables and who/why we might use them. It seems as though they're specific to different processes on a server, and are useful because they don't have to be stored directly in the code, where someone could simply look it up.

The evening session was downloading jQuery and making sure it was referenced in our Todo application correctly.

  - Todo List in Sinatra
    - Adding secrets management through `dotenv`
    - Adding JavaScript

__*Time spent*__<br/>
121 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I added some more intelligent secrets management in my Todo app in the morning; by storing the session key in a `.env` file (which we add to our `.gitignore` file so it can't be viewed publically) and using the `dotenv` gem. Adding the jQuery file to my app seems to slow it down significantly in production - I'm not entirely happy about adding such a massive file that currently isn't doing anything. I also added the jQuery functionality to delete a list or todo in the Todo app.

The evening session was looking at using AJAX to issue HTTP requests. This was a bit hard to follow - I don't really have good context of the jQuery code and it's nuances, so I'm just trying to follow the concepts of the video. However, I'm not fully grasping it - also not helped by the fact that I am massively exhausted too.

__*Time spent*__<br/>
125 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
In the morning I tried to parse the content relating to deleting lists and todos from the application using jQuery. The course recomments not worrying to much about the actual jQuery syntax, and worry more about the logic. I think I have a broad understanding of what is happening and why, but it still feels very unsatisfying. Without the fundamentals, I don't think I would be able to fully recreate this on my own.

The previous code used to delete todos created a bug in our application. Our previous todos in a list had ids based on their index within an array. When deleting an item via JavaScript, the index of a given todo would not update based on it's new position in the array, meaning that if were tried to check off another todo, the code would actually tick off a totally different todo item. The solution was to create a helper method to generate a fixed id that didn't depend on the position of the todo within an array. The evening was spent trying to refactor the given solutions to work within my framework.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Finished off the Todo List in Sinatra. Refactoring the index based code to take into account the deletion of lists/todos was very annoying, given my code was different to the boilerplate solutions. The CMS project is interesting, as it's starting to introduce testing, which is something I've been curious about how we can implement with Sinatra. Turns out Minitest works quite well with Sinatra - we just need another `rack-test` gem to create test response objects.

__*Time spent*__<br/>

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I'm still pretty bad at writing tests. I need to slow down and understand the exact routing that occurs for each request, and try to emulate those steps in the tests. This could involve multiple `GET` or `POST` requests in the one test!
