Starting the new year as I mean to finish it - with coding. Today was another revision session. I finished most of the Lesson 1 related content and moved onto Lesson 2. It's interesting to read different tutorials and the way they structure their content. It feels a little bit all over the place.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I've decided to cut down my weekend revision to 6 hours over the two days. 8 hours was tough over the past several months, but not really doable since lockdown has been over, since I have too many other life obligations to study that much and still get everything else I need done. I'm going to try study a bit more during the week to make up for this (perhaps 2 additional hours during the week).

Today was full of life stuff that prevented me from properly studying. I basically drove about 70% of the day.

I had some confusion around some usage of `self` within duck-typing, but I was confusing classes with objects instantiated from objects. Duck-typing almost seems like a trial and error way of creating polymorphism.
