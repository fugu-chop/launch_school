__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Starting the new year as I mean to finish it - with coding. Today was another revision session. I finished most of the Lesson 1 related content and moved onto Lesson 2. It's interesting to read different tutorials and the way they structure their content. It feels a little bit all over the place.
