- LS175 - Networked Applications

63 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The morning was utterly frustrating. After some minor refactoring locally of my Contact Book application, I pushed to Heroku and everything worked as planned. But for some reason, when launching locally, there was a strange bug in the search page that I could not replicate in production. After spending at least 30 minutes trying to debug, the solution was simply to clear my cookies for the application, with no code changes. That was frustrating.

I didn't end up studying in the evening. It was a rough day and I had too many chores to take care of. 

##### 02/07/21 (Fri)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS181 - Database Foundations
  - Revision

__*Time spent*__<br/>
122 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Did some more drilling of SQL syntax in the morning. I think the biggest challenge for me is remembering semi-colons on the end of my queries, as well as knowing for DDL, what commands can be chained together in a single `ALTER TABLE` statement, and what has to be separated out into multiple statements. Constraints are also a little fuzzy at the moment - I'm still not always certain when I can shorten the syntax for deletion/creation of constraints.

__*Time spent*__<br/>
180 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I spent the morning writing out my theory answers. These aren't strictly required as part of assessment preparation, but are useful in gaining mastery over database foundations and are a worthwhile investment of time, I think. I spent the rest of the day working through the SQL exercises.

__*Concepts covered*__<br/>

  - Revision

__*Time spent*__<br/>
183 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The speed of my theory answers is better, and I feel like I'm getting a much better grasp on the different theoretical concepts and how they fit in together with one another. The SQL syntax is also becoming more familiar. I feel as though I should be ready to take the assessment in a few days.

__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS181 - Database Foundations
  - Revision

__*Time spent*__<br/>
120 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I think I'll split my time between the theoretical answers and the practice questions from here on out. I think if I focus on one, I just don't retain the other effectively. I'm getting closer to being ready. Not long now.

More drilling of SQL syntax and theory. There are still some blank spots in respect of adding/removing constraints, particularly foreign keys. I will continue to practice these.

__*Time spent*__<br/>
91 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The morning revision session was a write-off. I was so tired and could barely concentrate on anything I was reading. I was still able to revise a few points on the column constaints (`NOT NULL`, `DEFAULT`), which should clear up some of my past confusions. The evening was spent finishing the rest of my compiled list of problems. I feel pretty good about the syntax now. I would take the test in the next few days, but my schedule is so busy that I won't be able to actually set aside 2 hours until the weekend.

##### 08/07/21 (Thu)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>

  - Revision

__*Time spent*__<br/>
125 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I did some revision of the SQL syntax and did a final run of my theory answers. At this stage, I don't think I'll benefit much from further revision, so I plan to take the assessment tomorrow.

##### 09/07/21 (Fri)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS181 - Database Foundations
  - Written Assessment

__*Time spent*__<br/>
100 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The written assessment didn't feel too bad. I managed to finish it ahead of time. We'll see how I go.

##### 10/07/21 (Sat)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS202 - HTML and CSS
  - Your First Web Page
    - Basic HTML
    - Shay Howe tutorial (Parts 1-3)
    - [Article on Semantic HTML](http://html5doctor.com/i-b-em-strong-element/)

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Got my LS181 assessment back, nailed it. This time, I'll go through LS202 (HTML & CSS) before going back into database applications. I think it will be a nice change of pace, especially since both LS185 and LS202 both don't require assessments.

Back on the HTML and CSS bus. This takes me back to when I first started learning HTML and CSS; the material I covered then certainly wasn't as detailed, or specific in respect of _why_ I should use certain tags or structures - the whole concept of semantic HTML wasn't covered, so I didn't really understand the difference between elements. I still have memories of HTML and CSS being incredibly fiddly and hard to work with, so hopefully this slightly different style of instruction should help that.

    - Shay Howe tutorial (Parts 1-3)
    - Classes, ids and names

__*Time spent*__<br/>
181 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Working through more HTML and CSS theory. So far, it's not been too bad, and feels like a nice change from the backend hammering that I've been doing for the past 8 months. Semantic HTML is a little confusing, since classifying elements appears to be highly contextual and open to opinion, certainly more than the rest of the Ruby related stuff I've been doing.
