__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The morning was utterly frustrating. After some minor refactoring locally of my Contact Book application, I pushed to Heroku and everything worked as planned. But for some reason, when launching locally, there was a strange bug in the search page that I could not replicate in production. After spending at least 30 minutes trying to debug, the solution was simply to clear my cookies for the application, with no code changes. That was frustrating.

I didn't end up studying in the evening. It was a rough day and I had too many chores to take care of.

Did some more drilling of SQL syntax in the morning. I think the biggest challenge for me is remembering semi-colons on the end of my queries, as well as knowing for DDL, what commands can be chained together in a single `ALTER TABLE` statement, and what has to be separated out into multiple statements. Constraints are also a little fuzzy at the moment - I'm still not always certain when I can shorten the syntax for deletion/creation of constraints.

I spent the morning writing out my theory answers. These aren't strictly required as part of assessment preparation, but are useful in gaining mastery over database foundations and are a worthwhile investment of time, I think. I spent the rest of the day working through the SQL exercises.

The speed of my theory answers is better, and I feel like I'm getting a much better grasp on the different theoretical concepts and how they fit in together with one another. The SQL syntax is also becoming more familiar. I feel as though I should be ready to take the assessment in a few days.

I think I'll split my time between the theoretical answers and the practice questions from here on out. I think if I focus on one, I just don't retain the other effectively. I'm getting closer to being ready. Not long now.
