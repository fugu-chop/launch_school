Concept revision is going pretty well. I feel reasonably confident that I am familiar enough with the concept to take the test over the weekend, or on Monday (public holiday). The next step is revise my answers, polishing up the language and to go through the Challenge exercises again, just so I can refamiliarise myself with the test-driven code approach that's in the coding challenge.

Just went through my notes and prepared answers today. Some revisions, though nothing too dramatic. I think tomorrow I'll go through the questions again, and then Sunday I'll start the Challenge exercises in preparation for taking the test on Monday.

Revisiting the challenge exercises is interesting. They seem to be harder than I remember, but I'm somehow solving them faster than I used to. Weird. I'll continue to practice these tomorrow - I think I should be in decent shape to take the test on Monday.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The Medium challenges were hit and miss. I completely messed up my initial implementation of the linked list challenge, making it almost impossible to solve the latter half of the test cases. I'm a bit nervous in that I might incorrectly setup up the implementation in the actual coding test, meaning I'll waste a tonne of time trying to solve it. Visions of RB109 arise, but I don't really see myself improving much, so I might as well press ahead with the actual test. I just need to slow down and apply PEDAC - hopefully the challenge doesn't have too many weird edge cases or tests that depend on a particular implementation.

##### 05/04/21 (Mon)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- RB139 Assessment

__*Time spent*__<br/>
212 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Completed the RB139 assessment today. Overall, the coding challenge wasn't particularly difficult. The only real problem I had to think about and come back to was regarding using the `&` in both contexts (i.e. an explicit block parameter on definition, and a `Proc` object as an argument converted to a block during method execution). Otherwise, I finished with plenty of time to spare.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Got my results for the RB139 assessment. I did well, but I dropped a point when I had to implement a `Proc#call` instance method within a block. It was a funny implementation that I hadn't seen before, and it didn't click during the assessment. 

The Networking Foundations course is a huge dump of information thus far - the whole idea of different layers of protocols is very intimidating and hard to understand. It's a bit of a brain burner at the moment, and makes me not want to be a network engineer.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The whole concept of protocols existing in different layers, layers being encapsulated versions of other layers, and the seeming reverse order of the layers is completely confusing. I'm finding it very hard to wrap my head around it all.

Moving pretty slowly. The content is kinda dense and I'm only feeling like I'm now starting to understand the concepts and really put the pieces together.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Morning revision was tough. Felt exceptionally sleepy, but managed to get some decent revision done. The Crash Course Videos were nice as a way of presenting previously convered information in a different format with different language.
