__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Concept revision is going pretty well. I feel reasonably confident that I am familiar enough with the concept to take the test over the weekend, or on Monday (public holiday). The next step is revise my answers, polishing up the language and to go through the Challenge exercises again, just so I can refamiliarise myself with the test-driven code approach that's in the coding challenge.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Just went through my notes and prepared answers today. Some revisions, though nothing too dramatic. I think tomorrow I'll go through the questions again, and then Sunday I'll start the Challenge exercises in preparation for taking the test on Monday.
