__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Concept revision is going pretty well. I feel reasonably confident that I am familiar enough with the concept to take the test over the weekend, or on Monday (public holiday). The next step is revise my answers, polishing up the language and to go through the Challenge exercises again, just so I can refamiliarise myself with the test-driven code approach that's in the coding challenge.

Just went through my notes and prepared answers today. Some revisions, though nothing too dramatic. I think tomorrow I'll go through the questions again, and then Sunday I'll start the Challenge exercises in preparation for taking the test on Monday.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Revisiting the challenge exercises is interesting. They seem to be harder than I remember, but I'm somehow solving them faster than I used to. Weird. I'll continue to practice these tomorrow - I think I should be in decent shape to take the test on Monday.

##### 04/04/21 (Sun)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>

  - Codewars Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>
232 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The Medium challenges were hit and miss. I completely messed up my initial implementation of the linked list challenge, making it almost impossible to solve the latter half of the test cases. I'm a bit nervous in that I might incorrectly setup up the implementation in the actual coding test, meaning I'll waste a tonne of time trying to solve it. Visions of RB109 arise, but I don't really see myself improving much, so I might as well press ahead with the actual test. I just need to slow down and apply PEDAC - hopefully the challenge doesn't have too many weird edge cases or tests that depend on a particular implementation.

##### 05/04/21 (Mon)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- RB139 Assessment

__*Time spent*__<br/>
212 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Completed the RB139 assessment today. Overall, the coding challenge wasn't particularly difficult. The only real problem I had to think about and come back to was regarding using the `&` in both contexts (i.e. an explicit block parameter on definition, and a `Proc` object as an argument converted to a block during method execution). Otherwise, I finished with plenty of time to spare.

##### 06/04/21 (Tue)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS170 - Networking Foundations
  - What is the internet?
- Revision
  - Codewars Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>
120 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Got my results for the RB139 assessment. I did well, but I dropped a point when I had to implement a `Proc#call` instance method within a block. It was a funny implementation that I hadn't seen before, and it didn't click during the assessment. 

The Networking Foundations course is a huge dump of information thus far - the whole idea of different layers of protocols is very intimidating and hard to understand. It's a bit of a brain burner at the moment, and makes me not want to be a network engineer.

  - Codewars Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>
119 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The whole concept of protocols existing in different layers, layers being encapsulated versions of other layers, and the seeming reverse order of the layers is completely confusing. I'm finding it very hard to wrap my head around it all.

##### 08/04/21 (Thu)

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Moving pretty slowly. The content is kinda dense and I'm only feeling like I'm now starting to understand the concepts and really put the pieces together.

##### 09/04/21 (Fri)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS170 - Networking Foundations
  - Lesson 1 Revision
  - Crash Course CS Videos

__*Time spent*__<br/>
120 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Morning revision was tough. Felt exceptionally sleepy, but managed to get some decent revision done. The Crash Course Videos were nice as a way of presenting previously convered information in a different format with different language. 

##### 10/04/21 (Sat)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS170 - Networking Foundations
  - Transport Layer
- Revision
  - Codewars Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>
180 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
More information overload. The TCP connection stuff is confusing. In theory, the three way handshake needs to occur on every request (which is what LS is teaching as the theory), but in practice, there are various mechanisms that allow a handshake to only occur once (or at least, less frequently than once per request).

##### 11/04/21 (Sun)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS170 - Networking Foundations
  - Transport Layer Revision
  - Quiz 2
  - Introduction to HTTP

__*Time spent*__<br/>
62 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Polished off the quiz for the Transport layer and it wasn't too bad. Today was a pretty hectic day in respect of life stuff. I'm pretty exhausted, and so only have done about an hour's worth of study. I did do extra earlier in the month, specifically in preparation for today though, so on track to keep my monthly hours of study up.

  - Codewars Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
This morning's study session was a bit distracted from life events. Still managed to push through. HTTP has so many things going on behind the scenes, it's pretty amazing that any of it works in a timely manner. The Codewars problems were a bit annoying, and relied on some Ruby dynamic typing properties in order to work properly (i.e. order of methods was important).

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
This morning's study felt particularly tough. I just couldn't wake up properly and struggled to focus at all on the material in front of me. I pushed through the evening, doing two separate sessions. The content is very theory heavy, and a little dry, even if it's applicable to everyday things, like browsing the internet.

I am making progress on the Codewars problems - I did two problems I marked as very hard. One of which I was able to solve relatively straightforward, the second of which I got about 90% of the way to the solution without assistance.

  - Lesson 3 Quiz
  - Working with HTTP

  - Codewars Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>
130 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The quiz was a bit difficult. Lots of different terminology and edge cases thrown in that weren't explicitly covered in the material. It's also cool learning more about bash and how we can work with it in the CLI. 

##### 16/04/21 (Fri)

  - Working with HTTP
  - Setting up an HTTP server
- Revision
  - Codewars Problems

__*Time spent*__<br/>
120 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Setting up an HTTP server is very cool, even if it's just running locally and doesn't do anything. I'm finally building something that's somewhat reflective of how applications work in the real world.

##### 17/04/21 (Sat)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS170 - Networking Foundations
  - Working with HTTP
  - Setting up an HTTP server

__*Time spent*__<br/>
180 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Spent a bunch of time troubleshooting the provided code, getting it to work on MacOS. Proud of myself for persisting and getting it right - it's a problem where Bash doesn't treat an empty line as having a character length of one (I have to pass another character after sending the `GET` request), but the browser __does__ treat the empty newline as having a character length of 1.

I basically spent the rest of the revision session trying to wrap my head around the specifics of the implementation. The Bash syntax is pretty self-explanatory, but some of the looping logic wasn't exactly clear.

##### 18/04/21 (Sun)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS170 - Networking Foundations
  - Setting up an HTTP server
  - Transport Layer Security
- Revision
  - OOP

__*Time spent*__<br/>
178 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Decided to change it up a little today and do some OOP revision. I was pleasantly surprised at how much of the overall concepts I still seem to retain. I guess this mastery based approach is pretty good at aiding retention - something I've traditionally struggled with.

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Today was mainly a revision session. I'm still sometimes fuzzy on the details of HTTP, which limits my ability to process more advanced course materials. 

##### 20/04/21 (Tue)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS170 - Networking Foundations
  - Transport Layer Security
  - TLS Quiz
  - Evolution of Networked Applications

__*Time spent*__<br/>
122 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The Networking history stuff is pretty interesting, since development of HTTP technology seems to be directly a result of problems with the previous versions. It's still not fully clear in my head how all of these different layers work and fit together - there's definitely a lot of revision to be done here.

##### 21/04/21 (Wed)

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Finished up the course today. A lot of revision required to ensure I can piece together all of these very detailed concepts in a cohesive way.

__*Time spent*__<br/>

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The blog series by Vahid Dejwakh on How the Internet Works is excellent. It's very detailed and clearly laid out, and provides a zoomed out, big picture view across all of the layers, something I've struggled to get a grasp of in my revision.

__*Time spent*__<br/>
122 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
I started writing down all the different concepts from my notes. It's simply too much content to keep a track of, just by reading it. It helps me structure the concepts a little better, and deprioritise all the excessive detail/fluff that's not required for the assessment.

##### 24/04/21 (Sat)
__*Concepts covered*__<br/>
- LS170 - Networking Foundations
  - Revision
  - [OSI Model Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKHCH6rw0As)

__*Time spent*__<br/>
180 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
The OSI Model video was really good. It covered the material at a pretty high level, but was a good overview of all the different layers and how they interact with each other. I'm still in need of further written revision - I'm not fully recalling all the information at demand, and I still don't think I have a good idea of a full end to end HTTP request and the different steps in that process. Revision continues!

__*Time spent*__<br/>
181 minutes

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Today's revision was pretty messy. I struggled to get a clean definition of what the Application layer did, and then reading through all the request related information was really hard. I'm going through it a lot slower, hoping to get some more clarity on interactions and the differences at each step.

__*Time spent*__<br/>

__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Revision continues. I'm at the point where I've covered off basically all the content in a more succinct fashion than my 'garbage dump' notes. It's time to put the pieces together now.
