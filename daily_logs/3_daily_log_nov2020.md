__*Thoughts*__<br/>
Today was an absolute slog. Reading and revising content isn't as enjoyable as solving problems, even though I know that knowing these principles will help me solve problems more effectively. 

Re-reading the blog posts on pass by reference versus value was a good use of time however, as I picked up a few things I didn't fully grasp on my first reading of them, like how pass by reference is effectively passing copies of references. 

Also, I've confirmed that the RB109 written assessment is purely explaining code. I shall focus my efforts on this over the next few days, with a view to taking the assessment next weekend.

The quizzes are good revision, and still tricky to get 100% on. The wording is __very__ specific, and easy to skip over if I'm trying to parse the question quickly. This is something I'll have to keep in mind for in the written assessment.
