Nothing too heavy so far. I've used the CLI pretty frequently through my 6 months or so of tutorials. I'm relatively familiar with navigation, so that didn't take too long. Practice was the most time consuming aspect of this. 

The environmental variable section was interesting - it's pretty similar to setting variables in other languages, and it gives me an idea of how to play around with my zsh settings. I'd previously just downloaded `.zshrc` files without really understanding what it was, or how it worked.

The idea of the `PATH` environmental variable is pretty cool. It's a shortcut for CLI to reference commands without the user having to specify the exact location where those commands are saved. 

Permissions is the newish content for me. Taking a little longer to wrap my head around it.

Finished off the book on the CLI. Permissions was a lot of stuff, but explained quite well and intuitively with examples in the book. Definitely helpful. 

I like how the Codecademy syntax seems to match the Rubocop style guidelines. Executing `.rb` files in the CLI is pretty slow.

Comparison operators are pretty similar to JS, which I am somewhat familiar with. String interpolation uses a different character to template strings in JS (`#` versus a `$`).

Ruby is interesting, in that there appear to be multiple obvious ways of doing the exact same thing - e.g. `while` versus `until` loops and `loop do end` all seem to achieve the exact same thing, I'm not really sure why so many options exist, unless there is some performance variation. 

Loops and ~~functions~~ methods are generally where the power of programming starts to be observed, so this is probably where things start to get interesting and useful. 

The face that what I regard as a `function` in other languages is called a `method` in Ruby is a bit disconcerting - I've always regarded methods as those `.action()` things you see appended to objects. Ruby treats calls these `.action()` methods `blocks`, which are equivalent to lambda functions in Python. 

Getting up early in the morning is pretty handy - it's really the only extended period of time that I can work without interruptions. Timing myself while working also keeps me accountable.
