## General Notes
While I can see that this topic is very important in the context of a software engineer, I don't think this course was taught/examined very well. The course material went into way too much detail (or the test was way too easy), such that it made putting together an overall mental model very difficult.

It was hard to know or focus on what was important; I was trying to synthesise all of the concepts into an overall view of network applications, which I know I still don't have a strong grasp of. The overall test was quite easy in comparison to the detail of the course material.
