## General Thoughts
This particular assessment was much more focused on writing syntax than theory. There were some tricky questions in the assessment, but luckily I was able to move through the quesitons relatively quickly so I could actually write and test code. I found this particular assessment in particular to be quite hard to be motivated and prepare for, since most of the revision was quite similar to the tasks in my day job.
