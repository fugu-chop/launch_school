# Launch School
A repo to house my various notes and workings for [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/). I started this course on the 10th of September, 2020. 

## Why?
I've been doing various tutorials on frontend web development over the last 6 months, learning a lot of *syntax* without really understanding the principles behind actual software development. Whenever I try to solve a problem, I find that I don't really recall the syntax required, and that my approaches are railroaded into specific syntax that I've learned or can remember. 

Based on the positive Reddit reviews and extensive (potentially marketing hype) write-ups on the Launch School website, I'm going back to basics, and start off on the Ruby track to learn both backend and frontend development. I'll have a better idea of which path I want to take as a software developer. 

I like the fact that I don't have a fixed time limit to complete modules - I am able to work around my schedule. I believe I will be able to keep on track by passion and willpower. 

## Approach
I'm going to take physical notes, and put a lot more emphasis on practice. 

One thing I found about doing web tutorials and taking notes on a computer was that I never remembered what I was doing 10 minutes after I did it. I used the computer as a memory dump, without really doing sufficient practice and reinforcement. 

I did some Codewars stuff, but this was fairly intermittent, and too discrete (not really focused on a building a whole project end to end). The web tutorials I did also focused on just pushing through content, rather than fully understanding it, and repeating it. These were also typically more passive, with me just following along rather than taking time to understand it. 

I'll also time myself for how long I spend (more as a way to keep myself from studying too much!) and log this. This isn't meant to be a target of hours spent, but rather to see __where__ I am spending my time - am I using sufficient time to reinforce concepts?

## Schedule
I will attempt to put in 2 hours per weekday, and 8 hours total over the weekend. Commitments, commitments.
